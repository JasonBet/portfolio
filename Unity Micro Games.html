							<p>These games featured on my Unity Play profile are a collection of micro games I made using Unity. 
								All scripts for these games were programmed using C#, and feature assets with animations.</p>
							<p>Each game is a demo of an old school classic game. The first game is a Platformer that features 3 enemy  
								types, physics, and combat. There are melee and ranged enemies that are programmed with a radius detection 
								AI to detect when the player is near. I implemented state machines for these enemies to 
								manage there behaviours and animations. I programmed the player script to be able to move left and right,
							to jump, and also to have a special double jump ability. I also implemented animations for the players movement.</p>
							<p>The next two games, Tower Defense & Shoot Em Up, both feature infinitely spawning enemies as well as a health 
								and score indicator. The Tower Defense game is a unique strategy game that features different enemy vehicles. 
								I designed these vehicles to have different speeds, health, and damage dealt to the player. I also created 
								3 powerful defense towers the player can purchase. There are set tower locations the player can place these 
								towers. I programmed the enemy behaviour to spawn and follow a track through the map. I also created scripts 
								for the defense toweers to attack the enemies nearest to them. Both the Tower Defense and Shoot Em Up game 
								feature explosion animations for the enemies. The Shoot Em Up game allows the player to control a powerful 
								plane that can fly in all 2D directions and fire an unlimited amount of rounds at the never ending wave 
								of enemies. I programmed the enemy planes to spawn randomly and track the player as they fire.</p>
							<p>The last game is a classic block destroyer game. The player manages a bouncing ball to destroy all the blocks. 
								I programmed a score indicator, as well as lives for the player. If the ball falls through the 
								bottom of the screen the player will lose a life and the ball will respawn.</p>
							<p>I had a blast learning about Game Design and Game Programming through these projects. If you would like to try 
								any of these games for yourself, or check any new uploads, click

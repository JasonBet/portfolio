							<p>Marion is a 2D Dungeon Crawler game made with Unity. This game boasts 5 levels including a final boss
								fight. Marion features a main playable character that can play using keyboard inputs. Additionally
								Marion features 3 enemy types, 1 npc type, 2 weapons, boss fight, and more!</p>
							<p>As a Gameplay Engineer I had key responsibilities in developing and designing core gameplay mechanics 
								and levels. I was responsible for creating the health system and corresponding UI. I also used C# 
								to script most of the enemy and player functionality. I programmed the combat system that allows 
								the enemies and player to give and receive damage. I did this using Inheritance with a base 
								character class that was inherited by each specific enemy type and player. I also created the UI 
								for the players health and Key/Arrow UI. In terms of level design, I was responsible for helping 
								design the 2nd level and singlehandedly designed the 4th and 5th (finall boss fight) levels.
								</p>
							<p>This game was made as an academic project in a group setting. The course (Software Engineering) was 
							structured to simulate a professional environment. This included having a client, QA team, CEO, designated 
							roles, documentation requirements, and more. Our team followed the Agile Scrum development methodology. 
							This entailled 2 week sprints, frequent team meetings, and scrum roles. As a team, we were required to 
							produce certain documentation for our game. This includes a Agile Gantt Chart, Use Case Diagram, Deployment 
							Diagram, etc. These documents as well as additional information about this project can be found

							<p>Marion is a 2D Dungeon Crawler game made with Unity. This game boasts 5 levels including a final boss
								fight. Marion features a main playable character that can play using keyboard inputs. Additionally
								Marion features 3 enemy types, 1 npc type, 2 weapons, boss fight, and more!</p>
							<p>As a Gameplay Engineer I had key responsibilities in developing and designing core gameplay mechanics 
								and levels. I was responsible for creating the health system and corresponding UI. I also used C# 
								to script most of the enemy and player functionality. I programmed the combat system that allows 
								the enemies and player to give and receive damage. I did this using Inheritance with a base 
								character class that was inherited by each specific enemy type and player. I also created the UI 
								for the players health and Key/Arrow UI. In terms of level design, I was responsible for helping 
								design the 2nd level and singlehandedly designed the 4th and 5th (finall boss fight) levels.
